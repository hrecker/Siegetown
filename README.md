# Game Overview
![Gameplay](screenshots/gameplay2.png?raw=true)
In Siegetown, you build up resources by managing your base, while defending it from enemy units. You place buildings on a grid, with certain buildings synergizing with each other to produce even more resources. With these resource you can buy your own units to fight back and eventually overwhelm the enemy forces.

Units battle in three lanes at the bottom of the screen. When a unit manages to cross the full screen, it will damage the enemy base. Be sure to reduce the enemy base to zero health before they do the same to you!

There are two available eras to play. Caveman era is simpler and has a smaller grid, and Medieval era has more complexity and a larger base grid. High scores are tracked, so you can see how many times you have won and lost, as well as your fastest time to victory in each era.
